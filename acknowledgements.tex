\acknowledge{%Thanks go here.
I would like to thank my advisor Stephanie Majewski for giving me this opportunity and guiding me through it, as well for the years of both professional and personal advice.  I would also like to thank the rest of my committee for the education and instruction they provided, especially the head of my committee, Jim Brau.  I would also like to thank Michael Begel for his patience and instruction during the year I worked with him at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Department of Energy that provided the opportunity to work there with the SCGSR program.  I'm also thankful to Walter Hopkins, who provided a lot of advice and showed me some slick coding tricks, and to the other students and postdocs who helped me along the way, including but not limited to Ben Allen, Jason Barkaloo, John Myers, Chaowaroj 'Max' Wanotayaroj, Kate Whalen, Aparajita Dattagupta, Giordon Stark, et cetera.  \\

This work would also not have been possible without the constant patience and support of my wife, Amanda Tumminelli, and our families, especially my Mom who always believed in me.
