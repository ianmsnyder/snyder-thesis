  A search for pair production of a scalar partner to the top
  quark in events with four or more jets plus missing transverse
  momentum is presented. An analysis of 36.1 \ifb\ of ${\rts=13\tev}$
  proton--proton collisions collected using the ATLAS detector at the
  LHC yielded no significant excess over the Standard Model background
  expectation. To interpret the results a supersymmetric model is used
  where the top squark is assumed to decay via $\stop \to t^{(*)} \ninoone$ and $\stop\to b\chinoonepm \to b  W^{\left(\ast\right)} \ninoone$, where $\ninoone$ ($\chinoonepm$) denotes the lightest neutralino (chargino). Exclusion limits are placed in terms of the top squark and
neutralino masses. Assuming branching fractions of $100\%$ to $t \ninoone$, top squark masses in the range
\stopLimLowLSP\ GeV are excluded for $\ninoone$ masses below
  $160\GeV$. In the case where $\mstop\sim m_t+\mLSP$ top squark
  masses between \stopLimDiag\ GeV are excluded.}
